# Dwarf-Canvas
Convert bitmaps to Dwarf Fortress color schemes

## Use
Currently only command line use is supported but I'll get to it eventually.

Just run
`dwarfcanvas.exe <input>.bmp <output>.txt`
and enjoy your new DF color scheme.

Your color scheme output will be created/overwritten at the location provided by your second argument. 

## Images
The program accepts 8x2 px BMP images as displayed in PeridexisErrant's Lazy Newb Pack, and can handle 3- and 4-byte wide pixels, meaning RGB, XRGB, and ARGB. Test images provided were exported from GIMP, **without** color space information.
